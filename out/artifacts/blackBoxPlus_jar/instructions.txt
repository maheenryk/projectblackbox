launch the game using by running any of the .bat files. 

you will be brought to a screen, click start game.

now you can choose whether to play with another person, or have the computer generate atoms for you to guess.

If you choose setter, you can place 4 to 6 atoms and give the computer to the other person who can then try
and guess where you placed the atoms.

If you choose experimenter, the computer will randomly generate atoms for you to guess.

the reason that there are 3 different .bat files is because the game doesn't have the functionality to 
pick how many atoms you want to guess as experimenter when playing with random atoms, so each of the 
bat files and its corresponding number launches a different version of the file with varying atoms. 

for example, running run4.bat and selecting experimenter will generate 4 atoms for you to guess.

when the game starts, you can set atoms by clicking on the hexagon cells, and delete atoms by clicking
on the atom you no longer want. you can fire rays by clicking on any ray node, the little circles on the 
edge of the cells, and click the "Fire Ray" button. Depending on the path of the ray, you will be able to 
see the exit point, if there is one, by the newly colored pair of ray nodes. You can refer to the color key
at the right of the board for the other ray outcomes. 

When you are finished guessing, click ready to see the results.

Happy gaming!
